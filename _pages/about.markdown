I was born in 1981 in Izmir, the city that lies on the most west coast of Turkey. After a still childhood, I was interested in computer programming in my early high school days, which I took up a hobby but became my profession later.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master’s degree in Computer Science. I am an experienced Java programmer, a mechanical engineer, a software engineer, a science and technology enthusiast. I am currently working at Adobe Systems as a Computer Scientist focusing on Distributed Systems and Web Services. I am also a passionate hobby researcher in fields, data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In addition, making contributions to F/OSS projects and leading open source projects [Rhino](https://ryos.io).

Besides science and technology, I am interested in photography and music. So, in my spare time, I am engaged with playing my electric guitar and taking photos in the streets which I use in my blog articles to look them crispy.
