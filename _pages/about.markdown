Hey there. I am Erhan. I was born in the early 80s in Izmir, Türkiye's west coast. After a still childhood, my interest in computer programming peaked in my early high school days, which I took up as a hobby but became my profession later.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master's degree in Computer Science. I am an experienced software engineer, mechanical engineer, and a science and technology enthusiast. I have worked at Adobe Systems as a Software Engineer focusing on Distributed Systems and Web Services. I am also a passionate hobby researcher in data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

In addition to science and tech stuff, I occasionally <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bagdemir/">take photographs</a>, draw comics, and play electric guitar in my spare time.
